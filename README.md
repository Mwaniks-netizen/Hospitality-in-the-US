# Hospitality-in-the-US
Forecasting US Hospitality Employment Trends using Seasonal ARIMA. The document is a quarto document which contains the code , the visualizations and explanations. It is an interactive document allowing anyone to explore the hospitality employment rates in the United States from year 2000.
After loading the dataset in R, i observed that there is significant seasonality in the data. This motivated me to use a seasonal ARIMA model to be able to capture the seasonality of the data.
After fitting the model and visualising the forecasts, the model captures the trend and seasonality quite well as shown in the last figure.
